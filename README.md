# MealTime
Version 1.0 (I have created a random meal generator using the mealDB. On a button click the app fetches a random recipe, complete with picture and youtube video, from the mealDB and displays neatly on the page. It's great for when you're in a pinch and need some inspiration for dinner.)

Version 2.0 (In version 2.0, I am going to be building the functionality of saving and retreiving recipes that were delicious and I'd like to make again in the future, or even just recipes that look interesting and I would like to save for later.)
